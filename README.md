# Breast_Cancer_Prediction
Breast cancer prediction is a crucial application of machine learning in the medical field. The aim is to develop models that can accurately predict whether a patient is likely to have breast cancer based on certain features and risk factors. Here are the general steps involved in building a breast cancer prediction model:
Data Collection: Obtain a dataset containing relevant features and labels related to breast cancer cases. The features may include factors like age, family history, hormone receptor status, tumor size, lymph node status, etc., and the label should indicate whether the patient has breast cancer or not.
